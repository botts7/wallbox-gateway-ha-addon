"""Compute the next scheduled charge in the charger's local timezone.

The Wallbox charger stores each schedule's ``days`` as a LOCAL weekday bitmask
(bit0=Sun) but ``start`` as a UTC ``HHMM``. The gateway firmware computes the
next charge in UTC, which lands a local-midnight window on the wrong day (a
Sydney "Sunday 00:00" == 14:00 UTC reads as Monday). We recompute it here with a
real timezone database (:mod:`zoneinfo`), anchoring on the stored UTC start
instant and checking the LOCAL weekday of that instant. That is DST-correct with
no offset arithmetic and nothing hardcoded — the offset comes entirely from the
tz database, seeded by the charger's own ``g_tzn`` zone name.
